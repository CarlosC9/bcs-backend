Support operations regarding Geographical layers

* Store raster layer in both:
  - Geoserver. For display
  - PostGIS. For calculations?

* How to translate temporary-user layers to unique PostGIS layers? (both feature and raster)
  - Postgres Schemas??
  - Or translate a GUI query to a PostGIS query?

New ENTITY "geolayer"
* tags/attributes.

Four areas:
* system wide layers
* system wide regions
* user layers
* user regions

* CRUD feature layer
  - list
  - read (WMS, WFS)
  - import. (name, ¿projection?, workspace, user, format, [sld], store (Geoserver or PostGIS), <file binary>)
  - export
* CRUD import export coverage layer. Includes PDA layers
* CRUD SLDs
  - select SLD for a layer. Default SLD for layer
  - generate SLD for common colormaps
* CRUD regions. A region is a multipolygon which can be used to filter
  - A feature table (PostGIS) for system REGIONS
  - A feature table per user for regions
  - How a region is created?
    - Direct
    - Direct selection of one or more existing polygons
    - Output of a GEOS function, which can include features and regions
      - A special type of function whose result would be a geopandas with no value columns?
        - The geometry would be the ¿OR/AND? combination of all rows
* Setup NGD workspaces: NGD-SYS, and NGD-USR
* Setup NGD layer groups: a tree, then assign layers into one (or more?) of them
  - PDA
  - Biota
  - Grafcan
  -
* Output raster layer. Apply SLD automatically, store in users workspace
* Output feature layer. Apply SLD automatically, store in users workspace
